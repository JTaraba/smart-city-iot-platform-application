# smart-city-iot-platform-application
The purpose of this project is to build and develop an IoT based platform that can be used by various generic smart city applications to better the way of life for a large urban area. Through the platform, an application is able to connect to specific portals, communication links, and data which is unique for each application. Through the governing Edge of the platform, cities will be able to specify which areas in their streets need a technological improvement. The implementation of this platform utilizes edge computing, tools from Amazon Web Services, machine learning models, and a MQTT broker for topic subscriptions. By taking our raw data from these tools we can apply big data analytics through regression and other machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions of verified data. All of the devices and sensors utilized in our implementation follow wifi localization rules in which they are able to be located by their proximity to the wireless connection. The implementation of our platform allows for the creation of new smart city applications for the future and creates a friendly development environment that welcomes all users and developers
